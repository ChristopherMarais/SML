# Practice/Optional Problems (do not submit)


\begin{enumerate}

\item  Complete  the R tutorial for the ISLR chapters 9 and 10.
You may find the Youtube videos by Trevor Hastie helpful; for links, see file \texttt{!\_youtube\_lab\_links.txt} in the subfolder \texttt{"[2].code/islr\_labs/"}

\item ISLR ch.09: 1

\item ISLR ch.10: 8


\item Optional typed problems:

\begin{enumerate}

\item In Lab 9.6.3, try to reproduce ROC curves by hand by varying the threshold t in the classification boundary f(x)=t. Plot the true positive (TP) rate vs t, false positive (FP) rate vs t, and TP(t) vs FP(t).

\item In the USArrests data, use the R function svd() to recover the output of princomp (PC sdev, scores and loadings) as discussed in the PCA lecture

\item Watch a Youtube video below about "eigenfaces" for an intuitive application of PCA to face recognition:
