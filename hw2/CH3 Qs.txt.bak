(a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict Sales using Price,
Urban, and US.
(b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be
careful—some of the variables in the model are qualitative!
(c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle
the qualitative variables properly.
(d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis
H0 : βj = 0?
(e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a
smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is
evidence of association with the outcome.
(f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?
(g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95 % confidence intervals for
the coefficient(s).
