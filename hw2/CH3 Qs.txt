4. I collect a set of data (n = 100 observations) containing a single
predictor and a quantitative response. I then fit a linear regression
model to the data, as well as a separate cubic regression, i.e. Y =
β0 + β1X + β2X2 + β3X3 + .
(a) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is linear,
i.e. Y = β0 + β1X + . Consider the training residual sum of
squares (RSS) for the linear regression, and also the training
RSS for the cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower
than the other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there
not enough information to tell? Justify your answer.
(b) Answer (a) using test rather than training RSS.
(c) Suppose that the true relationship between X and Y is not linear,
but we don’t know how far it is from linear. Consider the training
RSS for the linear regression, and also the training RSS for the
cubic regression. Would we expect one to be lower than the
other, would we expect them to be the same, or is there not
enough information to tell? Justify your answer.
(d) Answer (c) using test rather than training RSS.


10. This question should be answered using the Carseats data set.
(a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict Sales using Price,
Urban, and US.
(b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be
careful—some of the variables in the model are qualitative!
(c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle
the qualitative variables properly.
(d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis
H0 : βj = 0?
(e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a
smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is
evidence of association with the outcome.
(f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?
(g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95 % confidence intervals for
the coefficient(s).
